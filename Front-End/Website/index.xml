A student can submit python source code for an assignment via the front end web interface. Students submit one token for each member in their group. When all tokens are submitted, then they need to be validated.
Validation refers to making sure that all of the tokens submitted are associated with the same assignment. We allow very free form groups, and dont try to keep track of who is in which group.</description>

The Student Submissions (Enter Token) page was used to process student tokens. The tokens would be sent to a student&amp;rsquo;s email as soon as an assignment was created. The student would then validate the token, and only once the token was validated, would they be taken to the assignment submission page.
Inside html code are functions that are not displayed in the snapshot below.</description>
